# Plant database and query

This is a console application that keeps records of various plants, to help a user on managing their plants in their garden. Things that are relevant to the user is what type of plants there are, the common and botanical name, family, associated pests, favored soil conditions, sun exposure, and which plants are helpful in planting in proximity to other plants to prevent pests, infestations and favored soil conditions

The data is fake and has generated using mockaroo.com.

Disclaimer! Due to the nature of mockaroo to randomize datasets without reason, the entries doesn't make sense for a real world application; for instance a record can have a common name and botanical name that are different plants, or a plant might not at all grow in a specific type of soil thatâ€™s put as favored in the dataset.
